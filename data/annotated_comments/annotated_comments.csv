For each direction, it registers the slice i+1 on the slice i. It does that using a gaussian mask, centers on the spinal cord, and is applied on both the i and i+1 slices (inweight and refweight from flirt). NB: the code works on APRLIS output: - rough centerline - gaussian mask - transformation matrices Tx,Ty 2. smoothing of the centerline ------------------------------------------------ input: centerline, transfo matrices it fits in 3d (using an independent decomposition of the planes XZ and YZ) a spline function of order 1. apply the smoothed transformation matrices to the image --> gives a ""smoothly"" straighted spinal cord (but stil with errors due to deformation of strucutre related to curvatyre) output: - centerline fitted - transformation matrices Tx,Ty smoothed - straighted spinal cord --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright (c) 2013 NeuroPoly, Polytechnique Montreal <www.neuro.polymtl.ca> Authors: Julien Cohen-Adad, Geoffrey Leveque License: see the LICENSE.TXT ==========================================================================================",2020-09-23T19:19:13.875660Z,3

Proceed with the request normally, but provide the application with a wsgi.input stream that will send the ""100 Continue"" response if/when the application first attempts to read from the input stream. The read request must then remain blocked until the client responds. 3. Wait until the client decides that the server does not support expect/continue, and sends the request body on its own. (This is suboptimal, and is not recommended.) We used to do 3, but are now doing 1.
